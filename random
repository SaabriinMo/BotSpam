とにかくもう「ちょっと待って！」
叫びも虚しく消えて
僕はただただ迫るリミット
全力怯えてたんだ

現実とは容赦なくて
特に時間はヤバイね
それナシじゃ眠れないブランケット
奪われてくのに似てる

他愛もない　意味のわかんない
ことで笑ったり悩んだり
最後のチャイム　鳴り響けば
楽しい時間（とき）も修了（おわる）

if you were a dynomite, you wouldnt have enough power to blow your nose.
you're a human equivalent to a participation award and everyone who ever loved you was wrong!

バイバイYESTERDAY
365日分の学びを
カバンに詰め込んで
いつもみたいまたあした的に
バイバイYESTERDAY
365日分の出来事
僕を大人にしたなら
涙なんて　見せもしないで

なかったし選択肢
来たくて来たんじゃないし
強いて言うならご都合主義かな？
流された中継地

期待もしてないはずの場所に
予想外サプライズ　プレミアついて
うっかり離れ難くて　困るんだ

いつの間にか　染み込んでいた
僕の心の隅々まで
終わったって　育っちゃうよ
あのコトバが　道になって

バイバイYESTERDAY
365日分の想いは
抱えきれないから
こぼれそうさ　こぼれてしまうね
バイバイYESTERDAY
365日分の出来事
置いてけるわけないから
ぜんぶ持って　そろそろ行こうか

バイバイ　Good Good time
進もう　進もう　進もう　進もう
バイバイ　School School life
君も 君も　君も　君も
バイバイ　Good Good time
進もう　進もう　進もう　進もう
忘れない　School School life
いつも　いつも　いつも　いつも

'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong
This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go

Hey, so let's go
'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
Bring a friend, join the crowd
Whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk
Just move like we off the wall
Day or night the sky's alight
So we dance to the break of dawn
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine
So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh
This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money

I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak bitch I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
Bitch, I'm drownin'
Bitch, I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'


Daddy! Daddy! Do!
欲しいのさ あなたのすべてが
愛に抱かれ ギラギラ燃えてしまいたい
可愛げな kiss で one, two, three
目線そらしてズルイよね
火照り出すボクの気持ち もてあそぶみたいで
追いかけちゃ ダメなのは わかってる でも無理さ
一度踏み出せば 戻れなくて 仮面は脱ぎ捨てて
いけない言葉で 遊びが本気になる
Daddy! Daddy! Do!
欲しいのさ あなたのすべてが
騙されたら それでもいい もっと震わせて
魅せてくれ 僕だけに 笑顔の裏まで
愛に抱かれ ギラギラ燃えてしまいたい
躊躇などしない no, no, no
二度と逢えないひとだから
後悔に暮れるのなら 恋の火に焼かれたい
わざとでしょう 流し目が 愛しさを 刺激する
そっと振り返る 美しさに 心はつかまれて
呼吸が止まって 遊びが本気になる
Daddy! Daddy! Do!
ぶつけたい 想いのすべてを
綺麗なものだけじゃなくて 危険な願いも
止めないで その声が 僕を連れていく
愛に抱かれ ギラギラ燃えてしまいたい
「あなただけ」と言うくちびるが
優しく微笑むたび
飲み込まれて いざなわれて
未知の世界 触れて oh
Daddy! Daddy! Do!
最後まで あなたにゆだねて
壊れるなら それでもいい もっと狂わせて
魅せてくれ 僕だけに こころの奥まで
愛に抱かれ ギラギラ燃えたい
いのち果てる夜明けまで



Oh Love Me
Mister Oh Mister
Let me hear it, if it isn't a dream
Hey Mister, c'mon Mister
So sad that it makes me frantic

Feelings alone go wild
I nearly lose to that stare
Just us two, a dangerous GAME

Love is War
Love is War
Love is War

Let me dance, it gets dramatic from here
The premonition of a spiteful love, it excites me

The tip of my finger touches with a longing for destiny
I want to tell you
A confession of love
To break the walls of your heart

Oh Love Me
Mister Oh Mister
Let me hear it, if it isn't a dream
Hey Mister, c'mon Mister
So sad that it makes me frantic

Feelings alone go wild
I nearly lose to that stare
Just us two, a dangerous GAME

Love is War
Love is War
Love is War

You, pretend that you aren't interested
We are both playing the game

I don't need a sweet ending
Like in the old movies
I won't even reject lies
I want to be embraced by love
And become broken even more

Oh Love Me
Mister Oh Mister
Your beautiful profile, let me see it
Hey Mister, c'mon Mister
The kiss even is so far away

Hidden behind beauty
Eyes that are more than just pure
I am drawn into them, a dangerous GAME

Love is War
Love is War
Love is War

You never
Give me an answer
Tell me now, the secret of love

Oh Love Me
Oh Love Me
Mister Oh Mister
Let me hear it, if it isn't a dream
Hey Mister, c'mon Mister
With your lovely voice

My feelings can't stop
Just take everything that I have
Just for us two, a dangerous GAME

Love is War
Love is War
Love is War

Love is War
Love is War
Love is War

Love is War
Love is War
Love is War

笑えない日々を辿ったって
変わらない今を呪ったって
宙に舞った言葉じゃ
あなたを救えないのだろう

届かないままの景色と
温まることない痛みと
肩を寄せ合って歩いていた
遠いところへ行けるように

あなたの言う希望だとか
夢に見た理想ならば
どんなに冷たくたって愛してみせるよ

笑えない日々を辿ったって
変わらない今を呪ったって
宙に舞った言葉じゃ
あなたを救えないのだろう


不甲斐ない声で叫んだって
熱を持つ夜に変わっていく
この手が離れても
また歩いて行けるように
さよならは言わずに
何処かでまた会えるように


笑えない日々を辿ったって
変わらない今を呪ったって
宙に舞った言葉じゃ
あなたを救えないのだろう

届かないままの景色と
温まることない痛みと
肩を寄せ合って歩いていた
遠いところへ行けるように

あなたの言う希望だとか
夢に見た理想ならば
どんなに冷たくたって愛してみせるよ

笑えない日々を辿ったって
変わらない今を呪ったって
宙に舞った言葉じゃ
あなたを救えないのだろう

不甲斐ない声で叫んだって
熱を持つ夜に変わっていく
この手が離れても
また歩いて行けるように

分かち合うことない言葉が
ふと気付く度に増えていた
今と向き合って変わっていく
その姿を見ていて欲しい

あなたの言う未来は
ただ、この手に収まらなくて
どんなに繕ったって
その笑みの奥を疑ってしまうだろう

終わらない日々の向こうだって
救えないくらいの憂だって
この指がもがくほど
遠く滲んでしまうのだろう

触れない思いの色なんて
知りたくはないと思っていた
あなたが居なくても夢を見ていたいのに

象ったような不幸があなたを襲うなら
この手の平で触れていたいな
繕って吐いた言葉が誰かを呪うなら
口をつぐんでさ

笑えない日々を辿ったって
変わらない今を呪ったって
宙に舞った言葉じゃ
あなたを救えないのだろう

不甲斐ない声で叫んだって
熱を持つ夜に変わっていく
この手が離れても
また歩いて行けるように
さよならは言わずに
何処かでまた会えるように

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
It's the return of the "ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"
"Yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, "how can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!


La La La La Now comes the big leader
